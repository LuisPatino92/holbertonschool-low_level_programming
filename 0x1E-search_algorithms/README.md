## C - Search Algorithms

First touch with linear, binary, jump, interpolation, exponential, advanced binary and others searching algorithms.

Some files are just text answers to questions about Space and Time complexity of the diferent algorithms.

>**[0-linear.c](0-linear.c)**

Function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm.

- Prototype : `int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);`.
- Where `array` is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in.
- `size` is the number of elements in array.
- And `value` is the value to search for.

The function returns the first index where value is located If value is not present in array or if array is `NULL`, the function  returns -1.

Here, an example of how the function works:

    Lucho@0x1E-search_algorithms$ cat 0-main.c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include "search_algos.h"

    /**
     * main - Entry point
     *
     * Return: Always EXIT_SUCCESS
     */
    int main(void)
    {
        int array[] = {
            10, 1, 42, 3, 4, 42, 6, 7, -1, 9
        };
        size_t size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

        printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 3, linear_search(array, size, 3));
        printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 42, linear_search(array, size, 42));
        printf("Found %d at index: %d\n", 999, linear_search(array, size, 999));
        return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
    }
    Lucho@0x1E-search_algorithms$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 0-main.c 0-linear.c -o 0-linear
    Lucho@0x1E-search_algorithms$ ./0-linear
    Value checked array[0] = [10]
    Value checked array[1] = [1]
    Value checked array[2] = [42]
    Value checked array[3] = [3]
    Found 3 at index: 3

    Value checked array[0] = [10]
    Value checked array[1] = [1]
    Value checked array[2] = [42]
    Found 42 at index: 2

    Value checked array[0] = [10]
    Value checked array[1] = [1]
    Value checked array[2] = [42]
    Value checked array[3] = [3]
    Value checked array[4] = [4]
    Value checked array[5] = [42]
    Value checked array[6] = [6]
    Value checked array[7] = [7]
    Value checked array[8] = [-1]
    Value checked array[9] = [9]
    Found 999 at index: -1

>**[1-binary.c](1-binary.c)**

Function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm.

- Prototype : `int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);`.
- Where `array` is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in.
- `size` is the number of elements in array.
- And `value` is the value to search for.
- `array` has to be sorted.

The function returns the index where value is located If value is not present in array or if array is `NULL`, the function  returns -1.

Here, an example of how the function works:

    Lucho@0x1E-search_algorithms$ cat 1-main.c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include "search_algos.h"

    /**
     * main - Entry point
     *
     * Return: Always EXIT_SUCCESS
     */
    int main(void)
    {
        int array[] = {
            0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
        };
        size_t size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

        printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 2, binary_search(array, size, 2));
        printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 5, binary_search(array, 5, 5));
        printf("Found %d at index: %d\n", 999, binary_search(array, size, 999));
        return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
    }
    Lucho@0x1E-search_algorithms$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 1-main.c 1-binary.c -o 1-binary
    Lucho@0x1E-search_algorithms$ ./1-binary
    Searching in array: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    Searching in array: 0, 1, 2, 3
    Searching in array: 2, 3
    Found 2 at index: 2

    Searching in array: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    Searching in array: 3, 4
    Searching in array: 4
    Found 5 at index: -1

    Searching in array: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    Searching in array: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    Searching in array: 8, 9
